## What is that
This is a repository made for the 'programming technolages' subject in the HSE (university). 

### What does the task look like
1. Initialize git repository
2. Adding a file to it
3. Creating 2 branches that differently change the file
4. Try to merge them (we'll get merge conflict)
5. Create an issue on github
6. Resolve merge conflict and finally merge them
7. Mark issue as resolved 

### New task

1. Create project (any language allowed) with some mathematical operation.
2. Make git flow specified in the task.
3. Now I must to repeat some structure so I'll write some text here to cause merge conflict.
